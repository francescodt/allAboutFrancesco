        <h2>Why Are You Here?</h2>
        <section>
            <p>For me of course! I am a 27 year old with literal 0 coding experience. I am a competitive person at heart
                as well, which is what kills me to work with such smart individuals in my class; seriously, they are
                amazing. Enough about them! I am a "board-gamer," cancer "survivor," quotation "enthusiast,"
                concert-attender, and ice-breaker extraordinaire. </p>

        <h2>Resume` Related Stuff</h2>
        <section>
            <p>I graduated high-school and have attended many, <i>many</i>, different colleges (4 if you're curious),
                but have never graduated any of them. Generally I think traditional schooling isn't for me, so I've
                decided to head first into a school that I have no experience in! As you can see, I am full of
                tremendous ideas, but I think that kind of stuff is important. </p><br />
            <p>I've worked tons of jobs! At financials, in manufacturing and supply chain management, phone customer
                service, in-person customer service, sales, and a few others that are even less relevant than what I
                just listed. I have a well-rounded set of skills and good experience on where I come from. I'm excited
                to take all of that and apply it to a field that might not have those sort of traits from one
                human-being.</p>

        <h2>Goal, Goals, Goooaaaaaaaaals!</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Completing the class is probably my biggest goal. I want to accomplish something I haven't before, which
                is "graduating." Originally I had the idea that I'd come in and be the highest performer, but I am okay
                with not at this point. Definitely hard to be the highest performer in a room full of soon-to-be
                geniuses. I am not counting myself out, so that would be my second goal: Be the best at one particular
                thing coming out of the class. I would <i>love</i> to be known for something with this class. Honestly
                I'd take anything, but we'll see what I want it to be. </p>
